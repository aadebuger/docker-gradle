## Docker Gradle Container

This is a fairly straightforward [Docker](https://docker.com) container for the
[Gradle](https://gradle.org) build system. It extends from the official
[Java container](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/java/). Currently, there are
variants for Java 7 and 8 as well as Gradle 2.2 and 1.12
